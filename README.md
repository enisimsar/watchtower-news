### Why we have started this project?

In our EU project, we have needed to offer (in the project’s website) news, articles, blog posts for a European maker community.  

We evaluated different solutions. 
- We didn’t have enough budget for a **commercial solutions**: [newsapi.org](https://www.newsapi.org), [webhose.io](https://www.webhose.io), [datastreamer.io](https://www.datastreamer.io), [twingly](https://www.twingly.com), [Aylien News API](https://www.aylien.com/news-api).

- [News-please](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please) and [twitter-news](https://github.com/mishakob/twitter-news) require to specify URL of news websites and twitter handles respectively. We didn’t want to create and maintain such lists. Since the content is technical and the sources are spread around many websites / twitter accounts.
